In this project, you can choose/design any real world application or data analysis using Python
programming.
Alternatively, you can choose one problem from the exercises in Chapter 4 or any chapter after Chapter 4
of the textbook. This textbook has a rich collection of programming exercises, with varying complexities
and difficulties. Many problems have labels like
Challenge
Project
Challenge Project
Super Challenge Project
Research
Performance Analysis
Intro to Data Science
AI Project
etc.
You can pick any problem. Make sure you choose a project that is challenging enough for your intelligence
capacity but also simple enough for the short period of a summer course

What to Submit:
(1) A Project Report
If you are to choose/design your own application, you need to describe your problems and solutions in
detail. If you are to choose one in the textbook, you need to copy the problem description, and where the
problem is located (chapter, problem number and page number).
(2) The Code
(i)The Jupyter Notebook files (.ijpnb) files, if any. It is alright if you do not use Jupyter Notebook.
(ii) The Python script files.
Do not zip the files. Submit these files separately.
